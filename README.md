# syracuse-edu-test

My intention with this landing page is to have a simple, mobile-first design with a tagline indicating the content of the page, a brief introduction, and an easy to navigate and submit form to request information. I used existing Study Abroad pages as a guide for design - trying to keep color choices and layout consistent.

In addition, I added a few links that directs individuals to supportive information.
